# Summary

Test tail risk estimation on synthetic financial data.

Temporary repo to showcase project.

# Simulation

Generate fat-tailed joint distributions with Student t-copula
- Dynamic Equicorrelation (DECO) model (Engle, Kelly, 2012)

The tail risk is estimated using the following methods:
- Kelly method (Kelly, Jiang, 2014)
- Peak-over-threshold (POT) method
- Pareto distribution fitting
